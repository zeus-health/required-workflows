# Zus Required Workflows

These workflows are intended to be run as [Required Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/required-workflows) from all other Zus repositories as part of their CI workflows.

This setup eliminates having to configure mandatory security checks across every appropriate workflow in every Zus repository.
